## Introduction

Containers have become a popular way to package, distribute, and run applications, providing consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment. Azure DevOps offers a range of features to support containerized workflows, including Docker integration, Azure Container Registry (ACR) support, Kubernetes management, and more.

This README serves as a guide to help you leverage Azure DevOps to manage your containerized applications efficiently.

## Getting Started

To get started, ensure you have an Azure DevOps account. If you don't have one already, you can sign up for free [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/).

Clone this repository to your local machine to access the sample files and scripts provided.

## Setting Up Azure DevOps

Before you can start managing containers with Azure DevOps, you'll need to set up your Azure DevOps project and configure necessary services such as Azure Container Registry (ACR), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), etc. Refer to the official Azure DevOps documentation for detailed instructions on setting up your project and configuring services.

## Creating CI/CD Pipelines

Azure DevOps Pipelines allow you to automate the build, test, and deployment of containerized applications. You can define CI/CD pipelines using YAML or the visual designer in Azure DevOps.

## Deploying Containers

Azure DevOps integrates seamlessly with Docker and Azure Container Registry (ACR) to facilitate container deployment. You can push your container images to ACR and deploy them to various environments using Azure DevOps Pipelines.
